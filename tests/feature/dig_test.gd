## The shovel, and the ground it digs. Every profile is handed the shovel once —
## a new one starts with it, an old save is given it when it loads, and one lost
## since is not given back. Raid rooms hide lit ground worth digging, rolled with
## the room: holding the use key on it with the shovel in hand digs it up and
## puts what was buried into the run; letting go starts it over, and the digging
## is loud enough to turn the monsters near it round.
