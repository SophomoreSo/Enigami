## The phone as a rule (`Phone`): an alarm counts down on the clock it is
## given and rings when it runs out, for as long as a ring lasts; ringing, it
## calls every monster in earshot that goes anywhere, which comes to it and
## stands over it, and goes back to its own business when the ringing stops;
## put down on a room's floor it lies there (`PhoneProp`), is still there when
## the room is walked back into, goes with a parked raid, and is picked up
## again with interact; and its photos are files it keeps and throws away.
