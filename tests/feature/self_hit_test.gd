## What can strike the player who made it: a NEAR they cast touches them too,
## standing in its reach, with what came after it on the flow — a HEAL heals
## them — while a monster's NEAR spares the monster that cast it; and a thrown
## rock or rune strikes whoever threw it, once it has been clear of their hand
## and not before. And a thrown stone that runs out of speed in the air goes on
## striking what it falls onto, until it is down on the ground.
##
## Headless: nothing here is looked at.
