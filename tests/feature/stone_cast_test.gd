## A thrown stone's throw goes off where the stone stops (`Attacks.land`): a
## rock with a NEAR on it thrown at a wall touches whoever stands by the wall,
## one that runs out of speed in the air and falls touches whoever stands where
## it comes down, an ON HIT on it goes off from the point, and one spent on an
## enemy it struck lands harmless — a throw goes off once.
##
## In a made room with walls, with dummies for the throw to find. Headless:
## nothing here is looked at.
