## The raid's floor, laid by hand (`RaidMap`, `raid_rooms`): every room it names
## is a map that is there; one way in, with a start and an exit; the Arbiter's
## room with the Arbiter posted in it and its gate; every doorway and gate a
## room marks matched by the room it leads to, the way back; every room reached
## from the way in; and each room holding exactly what its map lays in it,
## nothing rolled. The database cannot see a map's marks, so this is where a
## floor that would strand a player fails.
