## The monster dictionary's rules (`GameState.bestiary`): a new game has met
## nothing; walking into a room in a raid meets every monster in it, and a
## monster's attack going off is its skill seen — the Arbiter's second form's
## once it has turned; what was met and seen is in the save and comes back with
## it; and a new game starts from nothing again.
##
## What the page draws of it is `tests/graphics/editor_close_test`'s.
