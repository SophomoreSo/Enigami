## A raid can be put down and picked back up. MAIN MENU inside one writes the
## run into the save slot instead of ending it, and opening that slot again
## walks back into the same raid rather than into the hideout.
##
## The map is not in the save — it grows from `raid_seed` — so what this checks
## is that the run written over it comes back: the room the player was standing
## in, where they were standing, what was left of them, the raid clock, and the
## rooms as the run had left them. It goes through disk, not memory: the save is
## written, the slot is read back, and the raid is rebuilt from what came out.
