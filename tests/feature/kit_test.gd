## Up to three weapons are carried, and one of them is in hand.
##
## At home the kit is what the rack was left carrying: picked weapon by weapon,
## three at most, never none. A raid is walked into with all of it — every
## weapon and the graph on each — and a key apart: a slot's own key, or a step
## along with the wheel, puts another in hand, and each keeps its own graph and
## its own wait between casts. Walking out takes the whole kit home; dying drops
## the whole kit where the player fell.
