## A room's loot is kept in one treasure box rather than left on the floor.
## Pressing interact beside it puts everything in it into the run at once; the
## box stays, open and empty, for as long as the raid does. What a kill knocks
## loose is not loot the room was found with, and still leaps out on its own.
