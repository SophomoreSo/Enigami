## POSSESS: a hit that puts the player's hands into the monster it strikes.
##
## Played on the bench, which has a floor, monsters to put down and somebody to
## talk to: the monster taken and on the player's side, the body left standing
## where it was and still hunted, the monster walking and jumping under the
## player's keys, passing for one of them until it attacks, hurt by the rest
## once it has, taking the weapon out of the body's hands, talking to the
## Sage — and every way out: the time, the key, the monster dying, a hop to
## the next one, and the body dying.
