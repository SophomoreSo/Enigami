## The opening scene, and the format it is written in.
##
## Two halves. First every file in `data/scenes` is read and checked the way
## `npc_test` checks the dialogue files — a misspelt direction or a walk to a
## mark that does not exist is a beat that quietly does nothing, and that is the
## sort of mistake that only shows up in front of a player. Then the real
## `intro.json` is played through beat by beat, so what the file says and what
## the stage does are checked against each other rather than separately.
