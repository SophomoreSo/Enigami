extends Node
## The skill boards the game ships with, and the tables they are read from.
##
## Each weapon's graph as a new profile gets it, every monster's, the dragon
## test's and the Jean Grey test's boards and the bench's seeker arrow are rows
## in the content database (`data/db/boards/`): a grid, and the parts placed on
## it. Which part feeds which follows from their ports and the way each faces,
## so a row a cell out of place is a board that quietly does nothing — a monster
## that never attacks, a weapon that will not swing. Every board has to build
## whole, have a root and let its flow out of the board — all of it: a board has
## one way out, and a branch that never gets there is an attack the monster was
## meant to have. Every board the code asks for by name has to be in the table;
## a weapon's graph has to start with the part the weapon says it does; and what
## the schema promises to refuse is tried against a scratch copy of it.
##
## No renderer needed: nothing here draws. The refusals print an `SQL error`
## line each from the extension, which is the point of them.
