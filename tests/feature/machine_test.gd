## The player's state machine, and the tables it is read from.
##
## All of the machine is rows in the content database
## (`data/db/machines/player.sql`): the states, the steps each takes every
## frame, the graph of ways between them, and the conditions that open each
## way, written as questions about what the player senses. What `Player` keeps
## is the words those rows name — its actions and its senses. Four things can
## go wrong between the two and none says so at run time: a row can name an
## action or a sense the player does not have, a condition can be written so
## that it does not read, the graph can leave a state with no way in, and a
## split can add up to more or less than one. Each is a failure here, and so
## is a set of conditions that opens two ways at once, or none. What the
## schema refuses is tried against a scratch copy of it. Then a real player is
## stood up, to see that the machine it built is the one the table describes
## and that it moves on it.
