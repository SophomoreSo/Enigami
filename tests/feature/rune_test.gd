## The rune (`Weapons.is_rune`): a rock with a charge stored in it. The attack
## button throws it, and the throw carries the stored charge for nothing; the
## cast button never throws it and never charges it. Thrown, it is spent:
## picked back up, the attack button still throws it, but bare — its graph cast
## not at all — until a hold of the cast button with it in hand has poured the
## player's own mana into it to the full, and it is lit again. What is in it is
## kept with the profile.
##
## Played in the hideout with the computer's hands, the way the rock's test is.
## Headless: nothing here is looked at.
