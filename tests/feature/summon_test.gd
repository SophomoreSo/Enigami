## SUMMON MODIFIER: what an attack calls up beside itself as it goes off.
## SUMMON PET calls a pet that follows its summoner, one to a summoner, and
## goes with them; with OFFENSIVE it goes for the nearest enemy near them and
## strikes it; with KAMIKAZE it flies at that enemy and blows itself up against
## it, and is gone. SUMMON BOLT, whose place KAMIKAZE took, is retired.
## ANTI-GRAVITY takes the weight off a bolt: a lobbed one flies straight.
##
## Headless: nothing here is looked at.
