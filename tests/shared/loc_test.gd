## Every language says everything, says it with the same placeholders in the
## same order, and can actually be drawn.
##
## The mistakes this is here to catch are all silent ones. A line nobody
## translated falls back to English and reads as a bug report from the wrong
## country. A `%s` and a `%d` swapped round prints a name where a number should
## be, or prints nothing at all. A key renamed in a screen and not in the files
## reads as its own name on screen. And a language whose letters no font on the
## machine carries draws as a column of empty boxes — which looks like the game
## is broken rather than like a font is missing.
##
## It also holds the two halves of the text together: what `localization/eng`
## says has to match the English left in the code and in `data/`, because that
## English is the fallback under it. If the two drift, a part added to
## `Components` would quietly ship with no translated name in any language and
## nothing would say so until somebody read the screen in Korean.
##
## No renderer needed: nothing here draws. Measuring a string and asking a font
## whether it has a letter both work headless.
