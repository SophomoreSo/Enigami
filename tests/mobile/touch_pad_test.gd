## The console the game draws on the glass, and the setting that puts it there.
##
## It is laid out the way a phone MOBA is — a floating stick under the left
## thumb, a stick per skill under the right — so what is checked here is what
## that scheme has to get right.
##
## **Where the controls sit.** The HUD owns the top-left corner and the whole
## bottom of the screen, and a control standing on either covers the health bar
## or the slot cards for as long as the game is played. Every one is measured
## against those bands, against every other control, and against its own word in
## both languages — on the design's 16:9 and on the shapes a phone or a tablet
## gives the screen instead, where each has to keep its distance from its own
## corner.
##
## **What a thumb does.** Against a real raid, with a real player carrying real
## slots: the stick does nothing until it has been dragged most of the way to
## its ring, where it walks them; dragged far out of the ring it sprints them,
## or far out below it crouches them, and the line the knob had to get out to
## lights to say which; a thumb with no room to drag that far is asked for as
## far as the glass goes; a stick keeps the finger that started it however far
## it is dragged; a skill button arms its slot, charges while it is held, aims
## where it is thrown and casts on release; a slot the player is not carrying is
## not on the pad at all.
##
## **What it costs the rest of the game.** While the pad is up the mouse is in a
## drawer, because the system turns every touch into a click and `attack` is
## bound to one. The bindings still read and still save while they are in there.
