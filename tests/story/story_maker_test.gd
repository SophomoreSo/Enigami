## The story maker's rules: a conversation written as a graph of nodes — who
## says what, with what expression and what motion in the letters, what anyone
## does as it starts, and where it leads, on to a node or by the answers to a
## question — put in, changed, linked and taken away; kept as a plain file and
## read back, a story written the old way read as a chain; handed to a
## character in the shape the database's conversations come in, and to a
## scene; and played on a map stood up empty, in each of its three ways: in
## the box with the player held still, free in bubbles with a question asked
## in the box, and as a novel read a press at a time with nobody playing —
## the walks walked, the poses held, the questions answered.
##
## No renderer needed: nothing here draws. Stories, and the map they are
## played on, are kept in scratch folders for the length of the test, never
## in the project's own.
