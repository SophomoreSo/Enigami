extends Node
## INVERT: the part that turns the part straight before it inside out, by that
## part's rows of `inversions`. DAMAGE's damage becomes a heal of the enemy
## struck, a burn, a chill or a stun a cleanse of it, GRAVITY's drag a push
## away, KNOCKBACK's throw a haul back, and SIZE, SPEED and RANGE make the
## attack as much less as they would have made it more. A part with no opposite
## is left as it was.
##
## Driven through the runner on real boards, so what is checked is what a cast
## really carries, and that only the one part before INVERT is turned round:
## what it took back is exactly what that part added, nothing more. What the
## new fields do once the hit lands is invert_hit_test's. And what the schema
## promises to refuse is tried against a scratch copy of it.
##
## No renderer needed: nothing here draws. The refusals print an `SQL error`
## line each from the extension, which is the point of them.
