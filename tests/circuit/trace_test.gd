## The editor must be able to say exactly where a board breaks: what the flow
## reaches, where it gets out of the board, and where it is lost.
##
## A flow goes from a part into the part beside it and no further, and the one
## place it becomes an attack is the way out: the middle of the board's right
## edge. There is no OUTPUT part — see `SkillBoard.follow`. And the root, where
## the flow starts, is moved and turned like any part, but never taken off.
