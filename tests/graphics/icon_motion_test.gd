## The part under the pointer moves on the assembly screen, through a film of
## its own (`Style.COMPONENT_MOTION`), the rest stand still, and a setting
## stops it (`Video.icon_motion`).
##
## Every part has a film, cut into frames seven pixels square, the first being
## its icon at rest — so a board whose parts are kept still shows the icons it
## always did — and no frame the same as the one before it, or the part would
## sit still for a beat it was not given. The film goes round: every frame comes
## up in the order the strip draws them, held as long as it says, and then the
## first again. The screen moves the one part under the pointer — the part in
## hand, the board's part, or the parts' row — from the moment the pointer
## comes onto it, starting on its icon at rest, and keeps every other part on
## its icon at rest; with the setting off, that one too. And the setting is
## kept where the screen mode and the camera shake are, and is on where
## nobody has set it.
##
## No renderer needed: the films are pictures in a table, and which one the
## screen draws is a question it answers.
