## The bench's drawer is drawn in UiKit's pixel look: every PIXEL×PIXEL block of
## what it draws is one colour, its buttons are the pixel face, and what it
## draws fits — the damage readout under the HUD's corner, the drawer under
## that and clear of the lines along the bottom, every button inside it, and
## nothing but the tab left on the screen once it is in.
##
## The block check covers the drawn part and not the buttons, which are Controls
## and cannot meet it: Godot centres a Button's label inside its box, the pixel
## face is 21px tall, and no box height makes both the border and the baseline
## land on an even row. A Control-built screen is held to the other standard —
## the pixel face at a multiple of 8px, square unsmoothed boxes, as
## `settings_pixel_test` and `hideout_pixel_test` check — and a one-pixel offset
## between a letter and the box around it is not visible. What is drawn by hand
## has no such excuse, so it is held to the block.
##
## Needs a real renderer: the block check reads the frame back.
