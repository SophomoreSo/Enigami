## While somebody talks to the player in the box, the readout steps aside: the
## HUD's bars go as the box opens, and
## the bench's damage line and drawer tab go with them — the tab answering
## nothing until they are back. All of it comes back once the talking stops.
##
## Talk in a bubble is not that. The player goes on playing through it, so the
## readout stays where it is.
##
## Played on the bench with its two talkers: the apprentice, who talks free, and
## the SAGE, talked to in the box with the keys, from the press that opens the
## conversation to the answer that ends it.
