## The light the picture is shown in, after aarthificial's deferred lights:
## the world drawn twice — its colours, and how it faces — and every lamp
## added to it afterwards.
##
## With nothing lit nothing is worked out, and the camera shows the world as
## it was drawn. A room made darker shows every colour times the light there
## is. A lamp adds what is under it, in its own colour: brightest under
## itself, nothing at its reach, and nothing at all past it; one that points
## lights only where it points; and the air in front of the picture catches
## the share it is told to.
##
## The normals: what says nothing is flat; a twin on the normals' layer says
## which way a thing drawn in code faces, and is never seen; something drawn
## over it afterwards wipes it out; a sprite's edge faces out of it, whichever
## way it is turned. A face turned to a lamp is lit by it, and one turned away
## is not. What gives its own light is drawn as it is, by the lamps and by the
## dark alike.
##
## Shadows: what stands in a lamp's light is dark behind and lit across its
## own face; each lamp's shadows are its own; a lamp inside a body still has
## it throw one, as from the edge the lamp is nearest, and a body's own light
## inside it takes none from it; and only so many lamps throw them at once.
##
## A light as the property of what gives it (`Shine`): made from its kind's
## row, giving its light where the thing is, going with it, and out when it is
## hidden or put out. Each of Blender's four types: a point, bright all over
## its radius; a spot, its cone turned with the thing; a sun, the same light
## everywhere, lighting what faces back up its way and throwing its shadows
## all one way; an area, light from the edge of its shape, its face alone or
## all round, a rectangle or an ellipse. And a flame's wavering, and a thing's
## own say in how lit it is.
##
## What is seen out past a room — the sky through its arches — is lit by
## nothing in the room, dimmed by nothing in it, and lit by a light out there
## with it.
##
## And the game's own: a room's rock faces the air and stops the light, a
## body throws a shadow and lights the room while it burns, a bolt is a lamp
## for as long as it flies, and the rock is a rock.
##
## Needs a real renderer: every pass is drawn on the graphics card and read
## back, and `--headless` draws nothing. Each thing is tried in a corner of
## the screen of its own, and its lamps put out before the next. A window the
## desk covers stops drawing altogether, so a frame it did not draw is drawn
## here by hand (`tick`); with HIDE_WINDOW set the window is put away as soon
## as it opens, and every frame is.
