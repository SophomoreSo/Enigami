## The hideout's panels are built in UiKit's pixel look and everything on them
## fits, with the profile at its widest: every facility maxed (the longest
## numbers), a full stash, a skill with a name too long for its row, and each
## weapon selected in turn. Checked on the built tree — every piece of text is
## the pixel face at a multiple of its native 8px, every box is square,
## unsmoothed and evenly bordered, the panel stays on the screen, and no text is
## wider than what holds it unless it is allowed to wrap or be cut short.
##
## The hideout is a room now, so these are the panels its stations open — the
## rack, the workbench and the counter, one column each. They are the columns
## the old screen showed all three of at once, which is why one test still
## covers all of them.
##
## And where each of those sits: a panel is a pinned title, the rows and the way
## out, and only the rows scroll. Scrolled whole, as it was, the counter's list
## carried its own title and the way back to the room clean off the screen — so
## every panel here is scrolled to its end and both pinned pieces are looked for
## on the screen afterwards.
