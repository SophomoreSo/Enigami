## The logo the game opens on (`LogoCard`): picked at random from the pool,
## every logo in it white to its edges once it is drawn, held over the title it
## goes into and gone by itself — or at once on a press, which never reaches the
## title under it.
##
## And the white in front of it, which is not the card's: the boot, in the
## project settings, and the iOS launch screen, in the export preset. From the
## moment the game is opened to the logo is one sheet of white, with no Godot on
## it.
##
## Last, the game as launched: the main scene opens on the card over its title.
## A game built inside a test, as this one and every other test builds it, does
## not — it goes straight to work.
