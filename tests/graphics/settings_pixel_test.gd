## The title's settings and the pause menu are built in UiKit's pixel look all
## the way down, including the controls list they share. The title's settings
## are three pages now — the two buttons themselves, the volumes and language
## behind GENERAL SETTINGS, and the rebinding list behind CONTROL SETTINGS —
## and the pause menu is two, so all five are checked: every piece of text is
## the pixel face at a multiple of its native 8px, every box is square,
## unsmoothed and evenly bordered, the sliders and scrollbars are replaced, the
## bindings still line up and fit, and the panel fits the width it is given. The
## pause menu is checked for one thing more — that its rows sit on something
## solid, since the raid behind it goes on being drawn and showed through them.
##
## Each button and its page are checked too: one page at a time is on screen,
## the button leads to it and BACK leads out of it.
##
## And the two settings that are about the machine rather than the game — the
## screen mode and whether an impact may move the camera — which both screens
## carry and which have to agree with `Video` about what is set. Camera shake is
## pressed and followed all the way down to `Fx`; the screen mode is not, since
## a test that took the whole display twice a run is a test that gets switched
## off. See the note where it is checked.
