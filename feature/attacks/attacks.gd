## Turns a resolved Payload into real things in the world, and resolves the
## hits those things cause (including trigger payloads).

## Every living actor that `team` is allowed to hurt.
## Every actor something of `team` can strike: the ones not on its side,
## alive. The Arena keeps the list (`Arena.against`), so this is a lookup and
## not a walk of the tree; it is the Arena's list, so read it and do not
## change it — one that wants its thrower or its caster besides adds them to a
## copy of its own.

## Everything an attack has put into the world and not finished with: bolts in
## the air, arcs and lunges still swinging, bursts still opening, and the
## follow-ups waiting their turn to fire.
##
## They are parented to the screen rather than to the room, because an attack
## has to outlive the actor that made it — so nothing about a room going away
## takes them with it, and a bolt fired on the way out of one room carried on
## across the next one, testing itself against walls that no longer existed. A
## screen calls this whenever the ground under them is replaced: a room change,
## a floor reset.

## A trigger's follow-up waits this long rather than going off inside the hit
## that caused it. Fired inline, a whole chain ran within a single frame, and
## every link read the attacker's position from before the current attack had
## moved them — so four chained dash-slashes computed the same start and the
## same destination and landed exactly on top of each other, reading as one
## dash that happened to hit four times. A beat between links lets each one
## start from where the last finished, and gives each its own dash to watch.
##
## What that needs is the frame after the hit, not a seventh of a second. At
## 0.14 a nine-link chain spent a second working through a room one metronome
## beat at a time, which is a chain of separate strikes rather than one long
## one; this is a few frames, enough to read each link and to let the lunge
## before it land the attacker.
const TRIGGER_DELAY := 0.045

## What one connection takes off the clock.
##
## A chain's links take the lighter one: the whole chain is a single blow, and
## stopping the clock in full for each of nine of them reads as a stutter rather
## than as a strike — and spends most of a second of real time doing it, because
## every stop slams the scale down and then eases back over the best part of ten
## frames.

## How far a lunge travels at size 1 with no RANGE on it. For DASHSLASH this is
## the cap on aiming it: the cursor decides where inside that range it lands.
## SIZE and RANGE carry it further (`Payload.lunge`).
const DASH_SLASH_REACH := 85.0

## HEADBUTT, PUNCH to a player. How far past the body's own reach the fist goes
## at size 1 with nothing in the way — a step, about a body and a half, where
## SWIFT STRIKE dashes — and how far to either side of its line it meets what
## is there. SIZE carries both further, as it
## does a swing's; RANGE does nothing to it, as to a swing.
const HEADBUTT_REACH := 44.0
const HEADBUTT_WIDTH := 12.0

## AUTO-AIM. How far one looks for something to go at, and how much further
## each one stacked looks: the first looks as far as SWIFT STRIKE+ used to,
## which was SWIFT STRIKE with this built in. A bolt looks as far as it
## carries, and a lunge as far as it lunges, if that is further, so one with
## RANGE on it goes at anything it can reach (`auto_aim_sight`).
const AUTO_AIM_SIGHT := 520.0
const AUTO_AIM_FURTHER := 0.5

## How much of its own distance an attack aimed at the shortest reach still
## covers. The right stick says how far a cast goes (`Player.aim_reach`, the
## `reach` a spawn is handed): a bolt's range, a thrown shot's arc, a lunge.
## Pushed just past its dead zone it goes this share of the way, and at
## the rim all of it. A burst and a swing happen where the caster stands and do
## not move with it.

## KNOCKBACK. The push it adds to a hit, in pixels a second, straight along the
## way the attack was going — on top of the hit's own shove, not instead of it.
## Bled off at `Actor.SHOVE_DECAY`, it carries an enemy that stands its ground
## some five cells, where an ordinary hit moves one less than a cell. Every
## KNOCKBACK stacked pushes as hard again. Thrown into a wall hard enough, the
## enemy cracks it and is hurt and stunned (`Actor.SLAM_SPEED`).

## PULL — and what an INVERT makes of KNOCKBACK, which is the same: how far
## short of whoever struck it the enemy dragged in stops, about a body apart.

## anything on the flow adds to it or takes its place.

	return 120.0 + p.damage * 2.0

## How hard `p`'s PULL drags, toward whoever struck: as hard as KNOCKBACK throws
## — the hit's own shove and KNOCKBACK_FORCE for every one stacked — and no
## harder than carries the enemy `far`, the gap to HOOK_SHORT of them, before
## the push bleeds off (`Actor.SHOVE_DECAY`): it ends up nearer them, never past.

## NEAR. How far round the enemy struck it reaches at size 1, about three
## cells, and how much further every NEAR stacked past the first carries it.
## KAMIKAZE's blast is as wide, and as much wider for each one stacked.
const NEAR_RADIUS := 90.0
const NEAR_WIDER := 0.5

## SHATTER. What a hit is worth against an enemy frost has already slowed: the
## frost breaks, the hit lands this much harder for every SHATTER stacked, and
## the enemy thaws. Breaking it is what pays, so there is one break to a chill —
## a board has to freeze them again to do it again.
const SHATTER_PER := 1.5

## MANA DRAIN. What one connection gives the caster back, for every MANA DRAIN
## stacked. Each connection pays, so a board that lands three bolts drains
## three times — that is what a leech build is for — and a trigger's follow-up
## pays like any other hit.
const MANA_PER_HIT := 6.0

## HEALTH DRAIN. The share of what a hit dealt that whoever struck it gets back
## as health, for every HEALTH DRAIN stacked. It is paid out of damage dealt, so
## a hit that hurt nothing — POSSESS taking a monster — heals nothing.
const HEALTH_DRAIN_SHARE := 0.2

## What a hit carrying `stacked` SHATTERs is multiplied by on a chilled enemy.
static func shatter_mul(stacked: int) -> float:
	return 1.0 + SHATTER_PER * float(stacked)

## How far `p`'s NEAR reaches round the enemy struck: its size, and every NEAR
## stacked on it.
static func near_radius(p: Payload) -> float:

## How far round its middle a reach of `stacked` NEARs — or KAMIKAZEs — goes at
