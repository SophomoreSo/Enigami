class_name Station
extends Node2D

## A place in the hideout you walk up to and press interact at: the weapon rack,
## the workbench, the merchant's counter, the gate out.
##
## It is the same gesture as talking to an `Npc` and as holding an extraction in
## a raid — stand close enough, press the key — and deliberately not a button:
## the hideout is a room now, and what is in a room is walked to.
##
## Nothing here draws. `graphics/views/hideout_world_view.gd` puts the sign over
## it and says what pressing it would do; this only knows where it stands, how
## close is close enough, and whether it is open for business.

## Pressed while the player was in range.

## How close the player has to stand, centre to centre. Wider than an NPC's
## talking range: a station is furniture with a footprint, not a person, and
## walking "up to" a counter should not mean standing inside it.

## Which station this is — "weapons", "bench", "shop", "gate". The world reads
