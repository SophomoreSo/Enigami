class_name TreasureBox
extends Node2D

## The loot a room was found with, kept in one box instead of lying about the
## floor. Walk up to it and press interact: everything in it goes into the bag
## at once, and the box stays where it stood, open and empty, for the rest of
## the raid.
##
## It is the same gesture as a `Station` in the hideout and an exit in a raid —
## stand close enough, press the key. What is in it is `contents`, which is the
## room's own `loot` record, shared rather than copied: opening the box is what
## takes things off that record, so a room walked out of and back into has the
## box as it was left. `graphics/views/treasure_box_view.gd` draws it.

## Pressed open while the player was in reach. `items` are the records that
## came out of it, `{"id": ...}` or `{"scrap": ...}`, the way `Room` rolls them.
