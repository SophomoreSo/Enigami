## The map creator: a grid of cells laid a mark at a time, in three layers
## (`MadeRoom`) — the ground and what stands on it, what stands behind it,
## and what is put about it — which SAVE keeps as a scene (`Maps`) and PLAY
## stands up on the spot, to be walked and fought through with a kit off the
## bench. What the marks of the last two layers are, and how all three look,
## is the map's tileset's: the picture's, by id.
##
## Two things happen here, one at a time. A map is **laid**: `lay` and its kin
## change one layer, a stroke at a time, and every stroke can be taken back.
## Or it is **played**: the map is stood up as a room with a player in it,
## parts are free and the graphs are copies of the profile's, as on the bench,
## but the body is the profile's own and can fall — and when it does, or R is
## pressed, the floor is set again as it was laid. Leaving play goes back to
## laying, with the map as it was.
##
## The map on the table is kept while the game runs: left for the title and
## come back to, it is as it was left, saved or not.
##
## Nothing here draws. `graphics/views/map_maker_view.gd` attaches itself to
## this node; the table the map is laid on is `graphics/ui/map_table.gd`, and
## a map stood up is drawn by its tileset (`graphics/tiles/`).
