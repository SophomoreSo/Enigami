class_name RaidMap
extends RefCounted

## The raid is one connected map of rooms rather than a queue of fights, and it
## is laid by hand: which map stands where on the floor is the `raid_rooms` rows
## of the content database (data/db/floors/), and each room is a map made in the
## map creator (`Maps`), holding what was laid in it — the monsters at their
## posts, the box, the ground to dig — and nothing rolled. Room records live
## here, so a cleared room stays cleared and loot left on the floor is still
## there when you come back.
##
## Two rooms side by side are joined through doorways their maps mark (`<`, `>`)
## and two one over the other through gates (`U`, `D`), where both rooms are on
## the floor; an exit stands on a room's `E` (`MadeRoom`). A map that names a
## floor's room is read again each time a raid is laid, so a room changed in the
## map creator — the player's own copy stands in front of the shipped one — is
## the room the next raid walks into.
