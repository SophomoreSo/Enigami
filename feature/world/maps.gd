class_name Maps
extends RefCounted

## The maps made in the map creator (`MapMaker`), kept as rows: each map's
## level info, its layers, and each layer's grid of cells, a row of the grid
## a row — the `maps`, `map_layers` and `map_rows` tables (data/db/schema.sql).
## A map comes out as a `MadeRoom` (`load_room`) and goes in as one (`save`).
## What is in one is data/db/README.md's **A map**.
##
## Two places hold them. The ones the game ships with are in the content
## database (`Db`), built from `data/db/maps/*.sql`, which the game only reads.
## The ones made on this machine are in `user://maps.db`, beside the save, which
## it writes: SAVE puts a map there, and one there stands in front of a shipped
## one under its name. Run from the project — the editor, or `godot --path` —
## SAVE also writes the map out as `data/db/maps/<id>.sql`, for `build.sh` to
## build into the content database and for it to ship.

## The player's own maps.

## The tables of `MINE`, as schema.sql has them, made there the first time it
## is opened. Kept the same as schema.sql's: `tests/feature/map_maker_test`
