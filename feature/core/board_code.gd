class_name BoardCode
extends RefCounted

## A board written out as a short code, so a build can be shared: pasted into a
## message, read down a phone, printed under a screenshot.
##
##     BoardCode.encode(board)   ->  "hBw4kTq2Nr8dGxMPvL5cJ"
##     BoardCode.decode(code)    ->  {"board": SkillBoard, "error": ""}
##
## **Case matters.** The alphabet is the digits, the capitals and the small
## letters — 61 characters, which carries a board in a little over half the
## length ten digits would. The one character left out is `0`, and it is left
## out for two reasons: 61 is prime, which is what makes the check character
## below catch everything it catches, and the pixel face draws `0` and `O` with
## exactly the same pixels. With no zero in the alphabet, a round character is
## always the letter.
##
## The face has no small letters either — it draws them as capitals — so a code
## on screen does not show its own case. That is why COPY is the way a code
## leaves the sheet; what matters here is that `hBw4k` and `HBW4K` are two
## different boards, whatever they look like.
##
## Nothing goes between the characters — no dashes, no spaces. A code is shown
## and copied as one unbroken run, which keeps it exactly as long as it has to
## be, makes it a single word to a double-click in a chat window, and means the
## code on the sheet is character for character the code on the clipboard.
##
## A code carries the circuit and only the circuit. Not the skill's name, which
## travels in the message beside it. Not the grid either, as a *rule*: a board
## pasted onto a workbench keeps that workbench's grid, and the size written
## into the code is there so a refusal can say which board the build was laid
## out for (see `SkillBoard.adopt`).
##
## Pure data, like the board it reads. Nothing here draws.

const VERSION := 1

## No `0`, and in this order for good: a character's place in this string is its
## value, so reordering it would change every code ever written down.
const ALPHABET := "123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

## --- the format -------------------------------------------------------------
##
## A bit stream, packed five characters to every twenty-nine bits, then one
## check character:
##
##     version   3 bits
##     width-1   4 bits          1..16 cells across
##     height-1  4 bits
##     parts     7 bits          up to 127 of them
##     then each part, in reading order:
##       cell    as many bits as width x height needs — 6 on a 7x5, 7 on an 11x9
##       part    6 bits, its number in CODE_IDS
##       facing  2 bits
##
## Parts go in reading order rather than the order they were placed, so one
## board is always one code however it was built up, and two players comparing
## codes by eye are comparing boards.
const VER_BITS := 3
const SIDE_BITS := 4
const COUNT_BITS := 7
const ID_BITS := 6
const ROT_BITS := 2

## Twenty-nine bits to five characters: 2^29 fits inside 61^5 with two per cent
## of the room to spare, and puts a whole number of bits against a whole number
## of characters — so every five characters *are* a word of the board, and five
## that come to more than WORD_MAX are a mistyped character rather than a board
## nobody can build. The five are not marked off in the code itself; they do
## not need to be, because a code's length says where each one starts.
const WORD_BITS := 29
const WORD_CHARS := 5
const WORD_MAX := (1 << WORD_BITS) - 1

## What the header's fields leave room for. A maxed Workbench grows an 11x9, so
## there is somewhere to keep growing.
const MAX_SIDE := 16
const MAX_PARTS := 127

## Every component's number in a code. **Only ever append to this.** A code
## written today has to mean the same board next year, so a part keeps its
## number for good, and a part that is one day retired keeps its number with it
## rather than letting the ones after it shuffle down — as WIRE and BEND have,
## see `Components.RETIRED`. ID_BITS leaves room for 64;
## `tests/feature/code_test.tscn` fails the moment a part here is neither
## defined nor retired, or a definition has no number here.

## The last character makes the whole code weigh nothing: every character is
## multiplied by its place in the line and the total comes to zero, counted
## modulo the size of the alphabet.
##
## That size being **prime** is the whole trick. One character wrong shifts the
## total by its weight times the difference, and neither can be zero, so it can
## never land back on zero. Two characters next to each other swapped shift it
## by the difference of their weights times the difference of the characters,
## and no two neighbours share a weight. So **every single wrong character and
## every pair of neighbours swapped is caught** — which are the two mistakes a
## person actually makes copying a code down — where a hash of the same one
## character length would let one error in sixty-one through.
const CHECK_MOD := 61

## Both ways a mistyped code shows up before it means anything, said the once:
## the check character failing and five characters no board could have written
## are the same news to the player.
##
## These are the names of the lines, not the lines: what a refusal actually
## says is in `localization/<lang>/editor.json` under `code_error`, so a code
## typed wrong is complained about in the language it was typed in. Read one
## with `error_text`.
