## The phone: the player's own, carried wherever they are played — a raid, the
## hideout — and brought up on its key (`open_phone`, P). What it looks like
## and what is on its screen is the picture's (`PhoneScreen`); this is what it
## is as a rule. An alarm, set for so many minutes and counted down on the
## clock of the world it is in (`tick`), that rings when it runs out — loud
## enough that every monster near it that goes anywhere comes to see
## (`Enemy.lure_to`), wherever it is: in the player's hand, or put down on the
## floor of a room (`PhoneProp`) and walked away from, which is the point of
## putting it down. And the photos it takes, kept as files beside the save
## (`save_photo`), for its gallery.
##
## Where it was put down is the run's: a phone left on a raid's floor is still
## there when its room is walked back into, goes with a parked raid
## (`Raid.park`), and is back in the hand when the raid is over or the hideout
## left (`recover`) — it is the player's, and they do not go without it.

## Something about it changed: the alarm, the ringing, where it is, the photos.
