class_name Boards
extends RefCounted

## The skill boards the game ships with, read from the content database and
## built into the `SkillBoard`s the circuit runs: the rows of `boards` and
## `board_parts` (see `data/db/README.md`). Each weapon's own graph as a new
## profile gets it, every monster's, and the dragon test's are here. What a
## player builds onto a weapon's graph is theirs, and lives in the save.
##
## A board is its grid and the parts placed on it. Which part feeds which is
## written down nowhere: the parts' ports and the way each faces already say
## it, and `SkillBoard.trace` walks it. Where the flow starts is the part each
## board marks as its root (`root` 1), and every board here has one; where it
## becomes an attack is the board's way out, the middle of its right edge, and
## no part stands for that.
##
## Nothing here falls back. A board that is not in the table comes back with
## nothing on it, a part that cannot go where its row puts it — off the grid,
## over another — is left off, and a board with no root is a board that never
## fires; `problems` says which, and `build` says so loudly. A weapon or a
## monster cannot fight with half a board, and would do it without a word if
## nobody looked.

## Every board in the table, by id.
