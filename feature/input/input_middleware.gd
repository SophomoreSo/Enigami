class_name InputMiddleware
extends RefCounted

## One stop on an `InputProvider`'s line. It is handed the frame's
## `InputState`, changes whatever it has a say in, and hands it on: the hands
## fill it in, a conversation empties it again, a walk writes over where it
## goes. None of them knows the others are there, and the body knows none of
## them.

## Where on the line it stands, lowest first. Middlewares of one rank stand in
## the order they joined.
##   HANDS   what fills the state in: the player's own hands (`Hands`), or
##           anything else that might drive a body.
##   ASSIST  what helps the hands say what they meant (`AimAssist`). Before the
##           holds, so a hold still has the last word.
##   HOLD    what takes the hands off it again (`HandsOff`).
##   STEER   what drives the body for itself (`WalkTo`). After the holds, so the
##           game can still walk a body nobody may move — the devlog puts its
##           navigation after its dialogue for the same reason.
