class_name Monsters
extends RefCounted

## Monster attacks are built on the same boards the player uses. That is what
## makes their drops legible: a kill can yield a part the monster was visibly
## using, so watching an attack teaches you how to build it. A monster names its
## board by id — `board`, and for the Arbiter's second form `board_phase2` —
## and the boards themselves are rows in the content database
## (`data/db/boards/monsters.sql`). One with no board attacks with nothing.
##
## Stats only. Which atlas character draws a monster, what colour its death
## bursts, and how a modifier is marked all live in `graphics/style.gd`, keyed
## by the same ids used here — so a monster added here still spawns and fights
## before anyone has chosen how it should look.

	## it stands, with the same flow, and dies in it. Fragile and quick, so it
	## is a thing to stop before it arrives.
