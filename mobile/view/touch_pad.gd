extends Control

## The console the game draws on the glass: a thumbstick under the left thumb,
## and under the right a stick that charges and casts the weapon's graph, one
## that swings it plain, and the keys that take no direction.
##
## Laid out the way a phone MOBA is, because that is the scheme this game's
## controls actually fit:
##
##   * **The left thumb is a stick, and there is nothing there until it moves.**
##     The left of the screen is empty; a thumb put down anywhere in it and
##     dragged grows the stick where it landed, and lifting takes it away again.
##     A thumb that only touches grows nothing. So it is never somewhere to
##     reach for and never in the way of the fight. It has to be dragged a
##     long way before it does anything, and its ring is the line between the
##     two things it can then do. Inside the ring, three quarters of the way
##     out sideways (`STICK_RUN`), it walks. Dragged far out of the ring it
##     means it: out to a side it sprints, and out below it crouches
##     (`STICK_SPRINT`, `STICK_CROUCH`) — as far past the ring again as the ring
##     is from its middle, the knob following the thumb out and standing clear
##     of the ring by then, so neither is anything a thumb does by leaning. Each
##     step is all or nothing, so none starts under a thumb that only drifted;
##     and each is marked where it is — the walk on the ring, the other two on
##     the lines the knob has to get out to — and lights (`_draw_reach`).
##   * **The cast button is a stick too.** Press it and the graph begins to
##     charge; drag and the charge aims; let go and it casts, where you were
##     pointing, with everything the hold paid for. The game's own
##     hold-to-charge is what a phone MOBA already asks a thumb to do — press,
##     drag, release — so the two are the same gesture and nothing had to be
##     invented. The weapon key is the same stick without the charge: the same
##     graph, cast as it is for as long as the thumb is down.
##     A press with no drag in it goes the way the left stick is pushing, or
##     the way the player faces. A drag aims it, measured from where the thumb
##     came down rather than from the button's middle, and how far it is
##     dragged is how far the attack goes: a bolt's range, a lunge, a throw
##     (`Player.aim_reach`). Let go, the cast keeps that aim until it has gone
##     off, whatever the left thumb does meanwhile.
##   * **HIT is USE when there is something to use.** The weapon's button turns
##     into the interact key while the player stands by an NPC, a station or
##     an exit (`use_near`, which the shell sets). A thumb already down keeps
##     what it pressed until it lifts, so walking into range mid-swing does
##     not turn a swing into a press. One button fewer under the right thumb,
##     and the two are never wanted in the same place: you do not hit what
##     you are talking to.
##   * **In a conversation the right of the screen is the page.** No button is
##     drawn there; a tap anywhere on it turns the page or takes the answer
##     the stick has picked. A button to find for every line is the wrong
##     thing to ask of a thumb that is reading.
##   * **Everything else is a key.** Jump, dash and the three screens
##     take no direction, so they are buttons and nothing more.
##
## Drawn rather than built, in UiKit's pixel look — `PixelDraw`, Silkscreen at
## its own size, whole blocks — so a phone is playing the same game a desk is.
## The sticks are round because a stick is round; `PixelDraw.disc` and `ring`
## rasterise a circle on the grid rather than drawing a smooth one.
##
## What a press does to the game is not decided here. A control says which
## actions it is holding and `Touch` (`mobile/input/touch.gd`) sends them, so this file
## knows nothing about charging and the player knows nothing about thumbs.
##
## **Where the controls sit is the whole design.** It is written out once, in
## the 1280x720 the game is laid out in, and checked against the HUD rather than
## guessed at: the HUD owns the top-left corner down to y=112 and the band along
## the bottom from y=592, so the hand sits between them.
##
## The screen is that size or bigger. `expand` stretch gives a display longer
## than 16:9 more width and a squarer one more height, and a thumb reaches no
## further on a longer phone, so nothing is scaled: each control keeps its
## distance from the corner it belongs to (`pin`, and `area`). The hand stays
## under the right thumb at the bottom-right, the three screens in the top-right
## corner, and the stick's zone down the left edge to the HUD's band, however
## far away the other side of the screen has gone.
## `tests/mobile/touch_pad_test` holds it all there, at 16:9 and off it.
##
## **The buttons are twice the size they were first drawn at**, their words and
## edges with them: on a phone's glass a cast button was smaller than the thumb
## pressing it. Doubled, the hand fills the room the HUD leaves it — CAST just
## under the three screens, DASH just over HIT and JUMP — so
## the gaps between them are about the least the test allows, and moving one
## means checking its neighbours. The movement stick kept its size: it is not a
## button, and is only ever drawn under a thumb that is already moving it.

## What a control is.
##
##   KEY   a button. Pressed while a thumb is on it, and nothing more.
##   MOVE  the movement stick. It has a zone rather than a place: it is drawn
##         nowhere until a thumb lands somewhere in that zone and drags, grows
##         where it landed, and is gone again the moment the thumb lifts.
##   AIM   a button that is also a stick. It holds its action the whole time and
##         the drag off it is where the cast goes.
enum Kind { KEY, MOVE, AIM }

## Which controls are on the screen. The shell picks it — `Game._touch_face` —
## since which of these the player is standing in is the shell's question and
## not the picture's.
##
##   PLAY    somebody has the controls: everything.
##   TALK    a conversation or a scene has them: the stick, which picks an
##           answer, and the key that turns the page.
##   SCREEN  a screen has them — the map, a station's panel. Only the keys that
##           close it again, or a phone would have no way out of a window it
##           opened.
##   CLEAR   the assembly board has them, and the whole glass with them.
##           Nothing: the board is touched itself and has its own CLOSE, right
##           where KIT, MAP and MENU would stand over it. The pad stays up, so
##           what the board calls a control is still its word on the glass.
enum Face { NONE, PLAY, TALK, SCREEN, CLEAR }

## Every control: what it presses, where it sits in the 1280x720 design, which
## corner of the screen it keeps to, and which faces it appears on.
##
## A `pin` is that corner, as how much of the screen's room past the design the
## control moves by, across and down: (1, 1) rides with the bottom-right corner
## and (1, 0) with the top-right. The stick's zone keeps the top-left and has a
## `grow` instead, so it runs down to the HUD's band however tall the screen is.
##
## A round control carries `at` and `radius`; the three screens carry a `rect`
## instead, because they are labelled plates rather than things a thumb rests
## on, and looking different is how they say so. A `throw` stick is one whose
## release is a cast: it keeps the aim it was let go with until that cast has
## gone off.

## The movement stick, as the four actions the game reads movement through.

## walks inside the ring (STICK_RUN) and sprints far out of it (STICK_SPRINT),
## which is one more key held with the walk's; down it crouches, as far out
## (STICK_CROUCH) — each of those two as far as `gate` says, which is nearer
## where the glass ends first. Up is the one left as it was — it only picks an
## answer in a conversation, past its own firm dead zone, and where the stick
## is up for that, down is the same.

## or crouch at all. So there the line is as far out as a thumb can still get —
