class_name Components
extends RefCounted

## Every skill-board part, as the content database has it: the rows of
## `parts`, `ports`, `effects`, `codes`, `retired_parts` and `renamed_parts`
## (see `data/db/README.md`), read the first time anything asks and kept.
##
## A component occupies one (or two) grid cells and declares the ports its flow
## leaves by in LOCAL space. Rotation `r` turns a local direction `d` into world
## direction `(d + r) % 4`. Direction indices: 0=East 1=South 2=West 3=North.
##
## A part costs one tick per cell it occupies, so `cells` is its tick cost too:
## time on the board is distance on the board, and what a cycle costs can be
## counted off the grid instead of looked up part by part.
##
## Inputs are not declared. A part takes flow on any edge that is not one of its
## own outputs, so the arrows drawn on the board describe its behaviour
## completely: rotation decides where a flow goes, never where it may come from.
## Where a flow *starts* is not a part's to say either: it is the board's root,
## whichever part that is — see `SkillBoard.root`. Nor is where it becomes an
## attack: that is the middle of the board's right edge — see
## `SkillBoard.way_out`.
##
## What a part does to a flow is rows too: its effects, each a change to one
## field of the `Payload` the flow carries, which `SkillRunner._apply` makes as
## the flow enters. Every row is held to the payload as it is read, and one that
## does not fit is one of `faults()` and left out, rather than guessed at.
##
## This is the one script in the circuit that names `Db`. Behaviour only: the
## colour and glyph a part is drawn with are in `graphics/style.gd`, keyed by the
## same id, and a part added to the table draws in its category's colour until
## someone gives it a glyph of its own.
