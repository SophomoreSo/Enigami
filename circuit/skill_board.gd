extends RefCounted

## A grid of placed components plus the rules for placing them.
## Pure data: the simulation lives in SkillRunner.
##
## Every board is rooted. The flow starts at `root`, the cell the weapon's own
## part is filed under — the sword's DASHSLASH, the gun's PROJECTILE, a
## monster's SLASH — and whatever stands there is the source of every cycle. It
## is moved and turned like any part (`move_root`), but it never leaves the
## board and nothing is dropped on it: it is the weapon's, not the bag's, and
## the build is everything wired on round it. There is no INPUT part any more;
## the root is where a flow starts.
##
## And every board lets its flow out at one place: the middle of its right edge
## (`way_out`). A flow that leaves there is an attack; one that leaves anywhere
## else is lost. There is no OUTPUT part any more either: the edge is where a
## flow becomes an attack, and it is the board's, not the build's.
##
## A flow goes from a part into the part beside it and no further: an empty cell
## carries nothing (`follow`). So a build is a chain of parts touching, from the
## root to the way out. A weapon with nothing built on it fires because its own
## part starts against the way out; to build onto it, the part is moved back and
## the build goes in between.

## what stood where the root now stands is left behind, see `adoptable`.
