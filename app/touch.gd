## The on-screen console: whether the game draws one, and what a thumb on it
## does to the rest of the game.
##
## A phone has no keyboard and no mouse, so a build for one has to put the
## controls on the glass. This is that setting and the plumbing under it; the
## console itself is a picture and is drawn in `graphics/ui/touch_pad.gd`.
##
## **A key on the pad presses an action, and nothing else knows.** Every control
## in the game is read through `Input` — `Input.is_action_pressed("jump")`,
## `Input.get_axis("move_left", "move_right")` — so a key here sends the same
## action the keyboard would, through `Input.parse_input_event`, and the rules
## cannot tell the difference. Nothing in `feature/` mentions a finger.
##
## Sending an action rather than calling `Input.action_press` is deliberate:
## a parsed event both sets the state that is polled **and** travels the tree,
## which is what PAUSE, MAP and KIT need — those are answered in
## `_unhandled_input`, and an action pressed straight into `Input` never gets
## there. It is also idempotent, where `Input.action_release` is not: called
## twice it reports a second release, and a skill is cast on the release of its
## key.
##
## Where the setting is kept: its own file, beside the pointer speed, the
## bindings and the language, for the same reason. Whether the controls are on
## the glass is a property of the machine in front of the player, not of the
## profile being played on it.

const PATH := "user://enigami_touch.json"

## OFF never, ON always, and AUTO wherever the machine is one you touch. AUTO
## is the default for the same reason the language is guessed from the desktop:
## somebody on a phone should not have to find the settings with controls that
## are not on the screen yet.
