## What the game looks like on the machine it is running on: whether the window
## fills the screen, and whether an impact is allowed to move the camera.
##
## Its own file beside the language, the key bindings and the pointer speed, and
## for the same reason: these are properties of the desk the game is sitting on,
## not of the profile being played on it. Throwing a save away does not put the
## window back or start the screen shaking again.

## Where the settings are kept.
const PATH := "user://enigami_video.json"

## Whether the window fills the screen.
##
## Off to start with. Taking the whole display is the sort of thing a game
## should be asked to do rather than do on the way in, and a window is the only
## state a player can get out of without finding this menu again.

## Whether an impact moves the camera. `Fx.shake` is what reads it.
##
## Off to start with, which is the answer to a question this setting exists to
## ask: shake is something a fair number of people cannot watch for long, and a
## comfort setting that has to be found before the game is playable defaults the
## wrong way round. Nothing about the fight changes either way — see `Fx`.

## How long the window is kept being asked, and how often. The mode is a
## request, not an assignment: macOS animates the change over about a third of
## a second and drops anything asked while an earlier one is still settling. Two
## presses inside that window left the screen full with the setting reading
## WINDOWED — recoverable, since pressing FULL SCREEN and then WINDOWED again
## asks from a standstill, but two presses to undo one is not an answer.
##
## So the ask is repeated on a clock until the window is in the mode wanted and
## stays there. Seconds rather than frames because what is being outlasted is an
## animation, and the machine this runs on draws as many frames in that time as
## it likes. It is not stopped early by the mode looking right: mid-transition
## it reports the mode it is heading for, and an ask that stopped there would
## stop just before the one that would have taken.
