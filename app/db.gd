extends Node

## The content database, `data/enigami.db`: what the game reads and never
## writes, kept as tables. The conversations, the player's state machine, the
## parts and the boards the game ships with, the menus, and the lines that
## hang in the rooms are in it today;
## whatever else is better kept as rows than as a file goes in beside them. It is built from
## the SQL under `data/db/` by the `build.sh` there — the README beside it has
## the tables and how to change them — and committed built, so nothing at run
## time needs anything but the file.
##
## This is the one script that names SQLite. A module asks for rows and gets
## dictionaries back:
##
##     Db.rows("SELECT id, name FROM characters WHERE id = ?", ["SAGE"])
##     Db.records("nodes", "character_id = ?", ["SAGE"], "rowid")
##
## It sits in `app/` for the reason `Loc` does: the rules name a character and
## a line, the picture reads that line's camera, and neither should have to
## know the words came out of a table. See ARCHITECTURE.md.
##
## **Every query falls back to nothing.** With the extension missing on a
## platform, or the file not shipped, a query answers with no rows and the
## reason is said once — so a build with no database plays with nobody to
## talk to, rather than crashing at the first NPC.

## The tables this build of the game reads. `data/db/schema.sql` writes the

## conversation that reads as empty.

## The rows of `table` as content — what a file would have held:

##   * A NULL is left out, so a line with no `sfx` has no `sfx` key rather

##     did.
##   * A column declared JSON comes out parsed — a Dictionary, an Array, a
##     String — or, when its text is not JSON, as that text: a `camera` is a
##     framing or the word `reset`, exactly as it was in the file. A number
##     SQLite kept as a number is already what parsing it would give, and
##     comes out as it is: an effect's `8` or `1.6`.

## `where`. Keys are Strings, whatever the extension hands back.
