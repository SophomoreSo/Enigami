## Every word the game says, in whichever language is picked.
##
## The text lives outside the code, under `localization/<lang>/<domain>.json`,
## one file per part of the game. A screen asks for a line by name:
##
##     Loc.t("menu.title.start")            # "START"  ·  "시작"
##     Loc.t("hud.slot.pulse_many", [n])  # "%d pulses" filled in
##
## Both modules may read it. It sits in `app/` for the same reason `Cues` does:
## the rules name a part and a monster, the picture names a button and a
## heading, and neither should have to reach into the other to find out how
## that word is spelled today. See `localization/README.md` for the format and
## ARCHITECTURE.md for where it sits.
##
## **Every lookup falls back.** A key the current language has not translated
## reads in the default language; a key nothing has reads as the key itself,
## with one warning. A language is therefore always playable the moment its
## folder exists, however little of it is filled in — which is what lets a
## translation land in pieces instead of all at once.

const DIR := "res://localization"
const DEFAULT := "eng"

## Kept out of the save: the language is a property of whoever is sitting at
## the machine, not of the profile they are playing, so wiping a profile must
## not put the game back into a language its player cannot read.
const PATH := "user://enigami_language.json"

## The languages offered, in menu order. `name` is deliberately written in the
## language itself — someone who has landed in the wrong one has to be able to
## find their way out of it.
##
## `fonts` names faces to borrow glyphs from for writing neither the bundled
## Latin faces nor the language's own face carries. Silkscreen and Playfair are
## Latin-only, so without a face of its own a Korean line draws as empty boxes;
## these are the last resort behind one.
##
## `face` is the size at which one pixel of the language's face is one pixel on
## screen — the size its glyphs were drawn at. Silkscreen is an 8px face, so
## Latin at `UiKit.PIXEL_TEXT` is doubled and lands on `UiKit.PIXEL`'s 2-pixel
## grid. 둥근모꼴 is a 16px face, so Hangul at that same size lands on a 1-pixel
## grid — finer, still whole pixels, and the only way to have it readable: a
## 16px Hangul body doubled would stand 26px tall against capitals of 10.
##
## It is also what `pixel_size` rounds to. A bitmap face has exactly one correct
## shape per pixel, and at a size its own size does not divide, FreeType hands
## back some strokes a pixel wider than others — hard-edged and ragged.
