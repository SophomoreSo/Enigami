## The screen gone wide while a conversation in the box has it: black bars
## come in over the top and the bottom of the picture, darkening as they come,
## until what is left between them is as wide for its height as a film in
## scope (`ASPECT`) — and go back out the same way once the conversation is
## over. A conversation in the box holds the player still and has the screen
## (`Npc`, in the box; FROZEN MOVEMENT in the story maker), and this is the
## picture saying so. Free talk leaves the screen as it is: the player goes on
## playing under it.
##
## The camera goes with them. Whoever stands on a room's floor stands where
## the bottom bar comes, so the two talking are taken into what the bars leave
## as they come in (`NpcView`, through `Fx.direct`); nothing under the bars is
## seen, so the camera may go as much further up or down than the screen's own
## framing as they stand deep, and they say how deep that is every frame
## (`Fx.bars`). The box hangs over the top bar the way it hung over the
## picture.
##
## Screen space, at the screen's resolution, on the PIXEL grid like the box. A
## screen as wide as that already, or wider, gets no bars.

## Over the pixel picture (`PixelCamera.LAYER`) and its prompts, one over it,
## and under the box (`DialogueBox.LAYER`).
