-- The board the dragon test's tower is built around (feature/world/dragon_test.gd):
-- a SWIFT STRIKE for its root, then an ON HIT whose branch walks three
-- OVERCLOCKs back round into the root, while its own flow leaves the board
-- straight ahead through AUTO-AIM — so every lunge, the first and each lap's,
-- goes at the nearest guard still standing and through. AUTO-AIM is on the
-- way out rather than in the ring, so a lap costs what it did when SWIFT
-- STRIKE+ had the aiming built in, and a full charge still buys nine. The root
-- takes flow like any other part, which is what lets the ring close on it.
-- Named in the code.
