-- The parts a skill board is built from (circuit/components.gd), in the order
-- the palette shows them — which is also the order the loot pool draws from.
--
-- A part is its numbers and what it does to a flow. `heat` is added to the
-- cooldown of every cast that passes through it; `cells` is its footprint and
-- its cost in ticks, so time on a board is distance on it. Its ports are the
-- sides a flow leaves it by, as it faces east. Its effects are what it does
-- to the payload a flow carries, as the flow enters it. The `name` and
-- `description` are the English, laid under localization/<lang>/parts.json
-- the way a line's text is laid under its translation.
--
-- What a part looks like — its colour, glyph and icon — is graphics/style.gd's,
-- keyed by the same id, and a part added here draws in its category's colour
-- until somebody gives it a look of its own. A part added here needs a number
-- in `codes`, or no board carrying it can be shared.
--
-- Where a flow starts and where it becomes an attack are not parts of their
-- own. They are the board's: its root, and its way out in the middle of its
-- right edge (circuit/skill_board.gd).

-- In the order the palette lays its blocks out. `states` is what a hit leaves
-- on what it strikes — FIRE, ICE, WATER, and POSSESS's hands in it — and was
-- `element`. `behavior` is
-- COMMON MODIFIER on screen, and holds what was the `stat` block — DAMAGE,
-- SIZE, SPEED, RANGE, SHATTER — as well; the two after it are what a bolt is
-- steered and carried by — PIERCE, HOMING, AUTO-AIM and ANTI-GRAVITY — and what
-- an attack calls up beside itself: a bolt in the air, a pet.

-- weapon's own part (`SkillBoard.root`). OUTPUT was where a flow became an
-- attack; the middle of the board's right edge is that now
-- (`SkillBoard.way_out`). A board that still has any of them reads with the
-- part left out and its cell left empty, and one that ended on an OUTPUT is
-- slid along to where its flow used to end (`SkillBoard.slide_onto_way_out`).
--
-- DASH lunged the caster along the aim as the attack went off. The player has

-- struck, and on a flow with no form was a burst of its own where it went off.

-- after it makes the flow that instead.
--
-- HEADBUTT, PUNCH wherever a player reads it, is the one form with no weapon in
-- it: the fist does the striking. A graph whose every attack is a HEADBUTT goes
-- off whether its weapon is in hand or not — the rock lying elsewhere, every
-- shuriken thrown, the hands in a monster that has not taken the weapon
-- (`Player.can_cast`) — and none of the weapon's multipliers weigh it
-- (`Weapons.BARE_FORMS`). It is the root of the empty hand's graph
-- (`Weapons.HAND`).
