#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build data/enigami.db from the SQL in this folder.
#
# schema.sql first, then every .sql in the folders beside it (dialogue/…) in
# path order, all in one transaction with foreign keys on — so a line that
# leads to a line that does not exist, or names an emotion nobody draws, is a
# failed build here rather than a conversation cut short in front of a
# player, and a broken seed leaves no database behind rather than half of one.
#
# The database is committed, built: the game and the tests read it as it is,
# and nothing at run time needs sqlite3. What is checked in has to be the
# build of what is checked in beside it, so a hash of the sources goes into
# `meta` as `source_hash`, and tests/story/dialogue_test fails when the .sql
# has moved on and this was not run. The recipe is repeated in that test;
# change one, change both.
#
# Usage:
#   data/db/build.sh
#
# Needs the sqlite3 command line: macOS has it, Linux has it as a package
# (`apt install sqlite3`), Windows from https://sqlite.org/download.html.
# $SQLITE names another binary.
