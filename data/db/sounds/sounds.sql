-- The sound bank: a row a sound effect. See "A sound" in README.md.
--
-- Every one is synthesised at boot by app/audio/audio.gd under its id, and
-- that is what plays while its `use_flag` is 'N'. To replace one with a made
-- sound: give its `description` to Stable Audio as the prompt, save what comes
-- back at its `path` (a WAV; Godot imports it on the next run of the editor
-- or `--import`), set `use_flag` to 'Y', and rebuild. A flag on a file that is
-- not there warns at boot and plays the synthesised sound still.
--
-- The descriptions say what the synthesised sound is like, so a made one can
-- take its place without the game changing character; make them say
-- something else to change it.
