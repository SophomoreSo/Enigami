extends Node2D

## A shuriken where it struck (`StuckShuriken`): the star, standing in the wall
## or the monster with a point in it, the way it was going. Coming down, it
## turns over as it falls.
##
## One that can be taken back glints now and then, a pixel of light running
## along it, so a wall with several in it says where they are without a mark
## over each — and each glints in its own time, or a room of them would flash.

## How fast one coming down turns over, in radians a second.
const TUMBLE := 18.0
## How often it glints, in seconds, and for how long.
