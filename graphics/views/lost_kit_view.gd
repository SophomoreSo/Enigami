## The kit a death left on the floor, drawn to be found.
##
## A room is 1280 across and full of scrap, monsters and spikes, so this is not
## drawn as one more thing on the ground: a beam stands over it that clears the
## platforms, and a ring goes out from it on a slow pulse. Whatever else is
## happening in the room, the eye lands on it from the doorway.

## from the far side of the room, not to mark a square foot of floor.
