class_name BenchView
extends Node2D

## A bench to sit on (`Bench`): a seat of planks four pixels off the floor on a
## leg at each end, and a back of two slats on two posts — drawn behind whoever
## sits on it, so a body sitting down sits in front of the back and on the seat
## (`PlayerView`'s sitting pose sits on that seat). Over it, while a press would
## sit the body down, the key that does: `PixelDraw.key_cap`, as a treasure box
## and a station show it, so walking up to a bench asks for the same press the
## same way.
##
## Drawn in pixels of the buffer the world is drawn into (`paint`), which the
## map creator's table draws it with too, smaller.
