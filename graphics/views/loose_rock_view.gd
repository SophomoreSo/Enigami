class_name LooseRockView
extends Node2D

## The rock, lying where it came down (`LooseRock`), drawn so it is found again:
## the rock itself, and over it a small mark in the weapon's own colour that
## bobs and breathes. It is the one weapon that can be left behind in a room,
## and it says where it is from across the room — quietly, since it is not the
## kit a death left (`LostKitView`), which is meant to be seen from the door.
##
## Still coming down it turns over as it bounces, a quarter at a time, the way
## it flew; lying still it lies the right way up.
##
## One that is still the throw as it falls (`LooseRock.strikes`) is drawn as the
## throw was in the air (`ProjectileView._draw_thrown`): its faint trail, and —
## with something built into it — its glow round it and the light it throws,
## until it strikes what it falls onto or comes down on the ground.
