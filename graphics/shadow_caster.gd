class_name ShadowCaster
extends Node2D

## Something that stands in a lamp's light and throws a shadow: the edges of
## it, each knowing which way it faces. It draws nothing itself. Whatever is
## lighting the picture (`Lighting`) asks which casters there are every frame,
## and has each lamp that throws shadows draw the edges near it its own way
## (`shadow.gdshader`): an edge turned from the lamp is drawn out away from it,
## and that is the edge's shadow.
##
## The edges are kept as a mesh, made once and drawn for every lamp — the
## video's shadow caster, and Unity's `ShadowUtility` it comes from: an edge is
## four corners, two that stay on it and two that go, with the way it faces
## kept where a picture's corner would keep its place in the texture. Nothing
## here is worked out again when a lamp moves, or when the caster does: where
## it is is the node's own transform.
##
## A caster is put wherever the thing that throws the shadow is, by its view:
## a room's rock is one (`RoomView`), and a body another (`ActorView`).
##
## A body throws its edges' shadow only in a spot's light or a sun's. A round
## light — a point's, an area's — is in front of a body or behind it, as the
## world draws the two, and not beside it in one plane: in front, the body
## throws its figure on the wall behind it, and behind, a patch of shadow at
## its feet, and it stands dark against the light but for a rim (`Lighting`).
## Its figure is what it is drawn as (`figures`).

## The group every caster in the tree is in, which is how it is found.

## has the body throw a shadow (`beyond`).
