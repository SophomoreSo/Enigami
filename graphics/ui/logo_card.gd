class_name LogoCard
extends Control

## What the game opens on, on every machine: one of the studio's logos, picked
## at random from the pool each time the game starts and held on white for a
## moment. Then the logo goes into the white, and the white into the title
## underneath — two steps rather than one, because faded together the black
## logo would ghost over the title, and the logo's own box of white would fade
## as a second sheet over the first and show as a lighter patch.
##
## The white is in front of it too. The engine boots onto it
## (`application/boot_splash/bg_color`), and an iPhone's launch screen is white
## with nothing on it — `graphics/assets/launch_paper.png` on PAPER, in the iOS
## export preset — since a launch screen cannot be picked: iOS shows one picture
## before a line of the game has run, baked into the app when it is exported and
## kept by the system after that. From the moment the game is opened to the
## logo, it is one sheet of white.
##
## The pool is every PNG in POOL, so a logo dropped there is one more the game
## may open on. A press of anything — a tap, a click, a key — goes straight to
## the fade, and nothing pressed while the card is up reaches the title under it.

## Where the logos are. Every PNG here is one the game may open on.

## How much brighter a logo is drawn than its file. The logos were saved on an
## off-white a shade under white, grainy the way a scan is, which on white would
## show as a faint warm box. Drawn this much brighter, all of that comes out
## white — every edge of them included — and their black, which no brightening
## lifts, stays as black as it was. The test holds every logo in the pool to it.
