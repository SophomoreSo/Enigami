class_name Hideout
extends Control

## Between raids. Pick the weapons you will carry — up to three, and the one
## the rack is left on is the one in hand — build on their graphs, spend loot
## on the facilities, and deploy.
##
## Built in UiKit's pixel look, like the title and the assembly screen: every
## piece of text is Silkscreen at a multiple of its native 8px and every box is
## square and unsmoothed.
##
## The pixel face runs up to twice as wide as the one it replaced, which this
## screen — three columns of dense text — has no room for: a line that ran past
## its column wraps inside it rather than widening it.
##
## Nothing here explains itself. There was a status line along the bottom that
## said what the mouse was on — a facility's effect, why a board would not fit,
## what a purchase cost — and it was taken out by hand: a panel is its rows and
## the way out of them, and nothing else.
##
## As a station's panel in mobile mode (`UiKit.mobile`) the same rows are built
## for a thumb: the words at THUMB_TEXT, and everything to press THUMB tall —
## which the kit's buttons already are there. The room builds the panel again
## when the mode is thrown under it (`HideoutWorldView`).

signal deploy_requested(weapon: String)

## The rack was left on a different weapon: picked, or the hand moved on to it
## because the one it was on was put back. On the whole screen nobody needs to
## know — the columns beside it are rebuilt with it — but as a station's panel
## the room outside it is what carries the choice to the gate.
