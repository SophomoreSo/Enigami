## Silkscreen at a multiple of its native 8px, borders are square and a whole

## reads as the same pixel art as the title and the world. Everything uses it
## now: the menus — the title's settings and the pause menu, which are the same
## rows twice — the hideout's panels, and the screens that draw themselves
## rather than being built out of Controls, which is the assembly screen, the
## bench readout and the raid HUD (see `PixelDraw`).

## --- mobile mode --------------------------------------------------------------
## Every menu has two layouts, and mobile mode (`Touch.wanted`) is what picks.
##
## A desk's is dense — a row is a line of text and a button the size of its
## word — because a pointer lands on a pixel. On a phone the 720 the game is
## laid out in is about 65mm of glass, so that same row is under 3mm of it and
## its words stand under a millimetre: a thing a thumb covers twice over, read
## at arm's length. So in mobile mode the kit builds the same rows at a thumb's
## size. Nothing to press stands under THUMB, a menu's words are written at
## THUMB_TEXT, a border is twice as thick, and a page runs most of the width of
## the screen. It is what the console already does with its own buttons
## (`TouchPad`), carried to the menus.
##
## What is on a page may differ too, and that is each screen's to say: the
## rebinding list has nothing to bind on a phone, a conversation's answers are
## plates to press, the assembly board's parts come a category at a time.
##
## A screen built of Controls is built again when the mode is thrown, the way it
## is when the language changes; one that draws itself asks every frame.
