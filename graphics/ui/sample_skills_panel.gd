class_name SampleSkillsPanel
extends BenchDrawer

## The bench's sample skills, in a drawer on the right edge of the screen: the
## graphs the proving grounds hand out (`Sandbox.samples`) — the dragon test's
## and the Jean Grey test's — each under the weapon it was built for and a line
## on what it does. Picking one puts it on that weapon at the bench, over the
## bench's copy and never the profile's, puts that weapon in hand, and pushes
## the drawer back in so it can be tried at once. It is a `BenchDrawer`, like
## the tools on the left, and either can be out without the other.
##
## Its tab hangs high on the right, under the top of the screen: on a phone the
## console's DASH and cast stick are lower down that edge, and a tab over one of
## them would be pulled every time the thumb went for it.

## The drawer's top edge.
