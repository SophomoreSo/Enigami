class_name ScreenPages
extends RefCounted

## The pages of the screen over a world with no map of its own — the bench,
## the hideout's workbench, a played map and the tests: the assembly board, the
## map's page, which says there is no map (`MapPanel`, with none to show), and
## the monster dictionary (`MonsterDex`). The MAP tab stands along the top there
## as it does in a raid, and the map's key puts its page up as it does there.
##
## One page is up at a time. Whether the screen is up at all is the world's
## `editing`, and which page is up is this: a tab, or another page's key, puts
## that page up in its place without the screen going anywhere. A raid's
## pages are the raid's own states instead (`Raid.set_reading_map`,
## `Raid.set_reading_dex`, `RaidView`), since there reading the map is a thing
## the raid knows about.
##
## The hideout's workbench has the perks for a page as well, a tab past these
## three. That page is not one of these: the tab is on every page here, and a
## press on it is the holder's to answer (`app/game.gd`, which puts the perks
## up in the screen's place).

## Builds the map's page and the dictionary beside `ed`, on the layer it is on,
## and puts the screen away through `close` from either as the board does from
