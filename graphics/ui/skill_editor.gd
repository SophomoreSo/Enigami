## The assembly screen: one weapon's graph. It is deliberately not a safe menu:
## in a raid the world keeps running behind it, so the panel stays translucent
## and compact and every action is a single click.
##
## The root — the weapon's own part — is drawn as a port pointing the way it
## hands the flow over. The hand moves and turns it like any part, but it never
## leaves the board and nothing is dropped on it: it is the weapon's, not the
## bag's.
##
## Down the left of the board stand the weapons whose graphs it opens (`shelf`),
## a plate each with the weapon's own picture on it at the PIXEL grid's two: the
## one open lit in the weapon's colour, and a press on another opening that
## one's graph instead. The weapon in hand stays in hand — every carried weapon
## has a graph and a runner of its own, and this only shows another of them —
## and with one weapon, or one board, nothing stands there at all. Last of them
## stands the empty hand (`EMPTY_HAND`): a plate with nothing on it, for a hand
## with nothing in it, which has no graph to open yet.
##
## In the middle of the board's right edge is the way out: an arrowhead through
## the frame, where a flow leaves the board and becomes an attack. It is not a
## part, and nothing is placed there — it is lit while a flow reaches it, and in
## the faults' red while none does, which is a board that casts nothing. A flow
## only goes from a part into the one beside it, so what reaches the arrow is a
## chain of parts touching, from the root to the cell against it. It bobs out
## of the board and back, pointing at the end a board's flow has to get to
## (`_way_out_bob`).
##
## Drawn in UiKit's pixel look, like the title and its settings: text is the
## pixel face at PIXEL_TEXT, and every fill, border, arrow and icon is whole
## PIXELs laid on the PIXEL grid, so the board reads as the same pixel art as the
## world under it. All of it goes through `PixelDraw`, which snaps to that grid.
## The pixel face has almost none of the symbols in `Style`'s part glyphs, so
## parts are drawn as their `Style.component_icon` instead — and the one under
## the pointer moving through its film, while that is let move
## (`Video.icon_motion`, `_icon`).
##
## The parts on the right are grouped by the category the rules give them —
## forms, elements, stats and the rest — each block named down the gutter beside
## it in the category's own colour, which is the colour its parts wear.
##
## There is no header over it: the board and the parts have the screen, side by
## side in the middle of it (`_desk_layout`), with an X in its top-left corner
## that closes it, and COPY and PASTE under the board.
## COPY puts the board on the clipboard as a code, and PASTE builds the board
## out of the code on the clipboard. What a pasted code costs is decided here —
## see `_paste_code`.
##
## **In mobile mode it is laid out for a thumb** (`UiKit.mobile`), and it is a
## different screen rather than this one drawn bigger — see "for a thumb" below.
## A desk's board is worked with a pointer: a wheel to turn a part, a second
## button to take one off, thirty-six parts in rows 20 high to pick from. A
## thumb has none of those. So there the board is as big as the screen lets it
## be, the parts come a category at a time, on tabs, each a plate to press, and
## what the wheel and the second button did are two plates under them: TURN and
## REMOVE, which act on the part a thumb last touched on the board.

## Mobile mode's screen, top to bottom and left to right:

##     a plate each, THUMB_BTN square, their pictures on them;
##   * the board, in the room under the X and left of the parts, its cells as big
##     as that room lets them be: at a desk a cell is as big as stands the
##     board as tall as the parts, 78 on a first workbench's seven by five,
##     and here that grid stands at 90 — 82 beside the weapons — a thumb's
##     width. Under it, COPY and PASTE, each THUMB_BTN tall;
##   * down the right, THUMB_PARTS wide and the screen's height, the parts: a
##     tab a category, and beside them the picked category's parts, a plate
##     each, with the name written at the size a thumb's page writes at. A
##     block's plates share the column's height between them, so nothing
##     scrolls — a list that scrolled under a thumb dragging a part out of it
