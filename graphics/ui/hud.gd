class_name Hud
extends Control

## Raid HUD: health, the bars a fight spends, and the weapons carried — the
## one in hand lit, the others beside it under the number of the key that
## draws each.
##
## Drawn rather than built, in UiKit's pixel look: Silkscreen at its own size,
## boxes square and unsmoothed with a PIXEL of edge, everything on the PIXEL
## grid — the standard the assembly screen and the bench readout are held to,
## and `PixelDraw` is the kit for all three. This was the last screen still
## writing in the default face at nine pixels, which read as another game's
## interface laid over this one.
##
## The pixel face runs up to twice as wide as the one it replaced, so the
## numbers it stands on are bigger too: the bars and the gaps between them are
## all `PIXEL`-multiples.
##
## What is not here is deliberate. The map is a window of its own now — see
## `MapPanel`, opened from `RaidView` — and the bag is gone: a list of parts
## nobody can spend until they are at the workbench was five lines of the screen
## saying nothing the assembly screen does not say better. Nor are the two lines
## of keys that ran along the bottom: what each key does is the controls
## screen's to say. Nor is the graph's square that stood under the bars with
## the wait until the next cast on it. Nor is a line across the top saying what
## just happened — the player deployed, loot picked up, a box opened: nothing is
## written over the room.
##
## It steps aside while somebody talks to the player (`talking`). A conversation
## in the box holds the player still and has the screen, and the bars are a
## readout of a fight nobody is in: only something else to look at beside the
## box.
##
## And it is put away while the screen the assembly board is on is up, on
## either of its pages — the board's, or in a raid the map's — by the view that
## opens it, which knows when it does. The screen has it all, and its top, the
## back arrow and the tabs (`ScreenTabs`), stands in the corner the bars do.

## The bars in the top-left corner: health, then the two thin ones under it.
