extends Control

## The raid map, as a window of its own: the floor plan, where you are standing
## on it, which exits you have found and how long you have been down here.
##
## It used to be a corner of the HUD, small enough that a room was a dot and the
## links between them were left out entirely. A window has the room to draw the
## floor the way the player walks it, so it draws the corridors too — and it
## costs what the workbench costs: the raid runs on behind it, the clock keeps
## climbing, and the player stands still while they read.
##
## It is the MAP page of the screen the weapons' graphs are on, a tab each along
## its top (`ScreenTabs`): the back arrow in the corner puts the screen away,
## and the GRAPH tab puts the assembly board up in the map's place
## (`page_picked`). The keys say the same: M, or ESC, puts it away, and the key
## that opens assembly puts the board up instead.
##
## The tab is there wherever the screen is, a raid or not, and so is this page:
## over the bench, the hideout's workbench and everywhere else with no floor
## plan to show it is the map's window with nothing on it but that there is no
## map (`_draw_none`).
##
## Drawn in UiKit's pixel look, like the assembly screen it shares the raid
## with: every fill, border and letter a whole PIXEL on the PIXEL grid, all of
## it through `PixelDraw`.
