extends Node

## Gives every gameplay node its picture.
##
## A node in `feature/` or `story/rules/` knows nothing about how it is drawn:
## it is spawned, it enters the tree, and this hands it a view of its own. That
## is the whole reason a change to how the player looks and a change to how the
## player moves never land in the same file — and why the game still runs,
## silently and invisibly, with this module absent.
##
## One watcher serves every module, but the tables are owned separately: what a
## story node is drawn with is `story/view/story_views.gd`, so the two are never
## edited together.
##
## A view is a plain child node. It reads its parent's state every frame and
## draws from it; it never writes back.
