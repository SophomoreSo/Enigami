## landing, a slide down a wall asks every frame — so each kind is drawn from a
## pool of its own (`Pool`): borrowed, set going and let go of in one breath,
## it plays itself out and goes back to wait for the next. A screen that goes
## away takes back at once whatever it still had out, so none outlives the
## fight it belonged to.
